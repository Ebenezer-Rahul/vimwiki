= problem =

Find elements with a freqency of 1/k in an array or stream
without having to maintain a map of size o(n)

do it in o(k) 

== idea ==

Same idea as that of majority element but instead of having a single element and a single count
variable 

whenever an element comes which is one of the k elements incr the corressponding element
and whenever none comes just decrement all of them when one of them gets to < 0 replace it with the new element


// still doubts on how to verify ??
