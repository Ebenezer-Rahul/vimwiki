== Caching == 

implement a cache in functions or a better one is to implement a memorize 
template Function


== Efficient DataEncoding ==

Example :
	for-say date 
	{{{C
		struct Date {
			int year 13;
			int month 4;
			int day 5;
		}
		//better in terms of both efficiency and compuatutaion

	}}}

== Sparsity ==

Reprasenting sparse data 

- Matrices
	1. Representing in form of row, columns, vals //Will explain the details later
	2. at index i in the rows array we store the index of colums array which corresponds to this row
	3. then in the columns array we store all the columns numbers of non zero elements
	4. in the correspong vals array we store the actual value
	5. drastically less work if the matrix is sparse when multiplying or transforming

	_store vals and columns array in the same array improves cache locality_
	

	*Note Need to write it better, its simple*
- Graphs
	1. Store Offsets array and Edges array
	2. In the offsets array store the indices corresponding to Edges array corresponding to the current vertex


- Partial Loop Unrolling

- Sentinals
	1. Adding Dummy Nodes/Data which make checking boundries easy.
