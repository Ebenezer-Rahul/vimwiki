= problem =

Sample k elements from a stream of unknown elements 
such that each element in stream has a equall probability of
getting picked

== idea == 

think about when we are processing the n-th element in the stream

pick this n-th elemenet with a probablity of k/n. and replace the any of the k current samples with this
instead

we can prove that this works { i.e sample uniformly } with induction.

informally assume that after seeing n-1 elements in stream an element. probablity of it being in stream is k/n-1
now after processing the k-th element. the probablity of it being a sample is 
=>(k/(n-1)) * ((k-1)/k) * (k/n) + ((n-k)/n)*(k/(n-1)) 
=> (k/n-1) * (((k -1) / n) + 1 -k/n) 
=> (k/(n-1)) * ((n-1) / n)
=> k/n
*
There's an implemtation trick by not generating random number twice 
for each element in stream i.e
int r = randInd();

if r % n < k 
	pick and replace 
	r%n th element from current sample
